# hello-flask-zappa.pipeline.side8

Demo of a flask zappa app that implements pipeline.side8.

The Zappa lambda is generated using the `zappa package` command, after which it shifts over to the pipeline.side8 pipeline instead of using zappa for deployments.

The cloudformation.yml can easily be tweaked to support other AWS services.
